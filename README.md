# Tank Rating

[My Notes](notes.md)

This application allows a user to create an account, then vote on their favorite tanks. It then displays the tanks in order of greatest to least votes on the screen for the all users to see. Each tank will be listed and include a small picture of the tank for refrence.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever wanted to know which tanks are liked the most? My startup provides a way for users to vote on their favorite tanks and see the overall ratings of the tanks. The application will count up the total votes for each tank and display them in order from highest to lowest. Then we will know the favorite tank!


### Design

#### Ranked Page
<img src="tankRatingDesign.jpg" style="width:50%;" />

#### Voting Page
<img src="tankRatingVote.jpg" style="width:50%;" />

The top image shows what the ranked page would look like, displaying the tanks in highest to lowest rating and the votes each tank has received. The second image shows the voting page where users will select three tanks add a vote to.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **CSS** - Used to implement graphic design to make the application look nice, using nice colors and graphics.
- **React** - Will allow users to login, vote, and change pages between voting and ratings view page. 
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for -
    * login, logout, and register users
    * retrieve choices for display
    * submit votes
- **DB/Login** - Store user information like login and vote choices.
- **WebSocket** - Updates rankings for all to see.
